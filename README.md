# Digit-Recognition-with-MNIST-Dataset-project-Digit-Recognition-with-MNIST-Dataset
This project implements a digit recognition system using machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The system is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

Overview
The project follows these main steps:

Data Preparation: The MNIST dataset is downloaded and preprocessed. The pixel values of the images are normalized to a range between 0 and 1, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets.

Model Building: A neural network model is constructed using either TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model architecture typically consists of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers. For example, in TensorFlow, a sequential model with densely connected layers is used, while in PyTorch, a custom neural network class is defined.

Model Training: The model is trained on the training set using an appropriate optimizer and loss function. Training involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the loss between predicted and actual labels.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the testing set to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy are calculated to measure the model's ability to correctly classify digits.
